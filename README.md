Bettbok is an android app that helps you keep track of your tick bites. The user can for instance save the date of the bite and see how many days has passed since they got a bite. They can also take pictures to detect changes in the skin around the bite.

The project is part of the last module in the course Development of Mobile Applications at UmeÃ¥ University in 2020.
